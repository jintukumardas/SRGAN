# Project Title: Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks

# Description: 
This project implements Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGAN) for single image super-resolution. SRGAN is a deep learning model that can be used to increase the resolution of images. The model is trained on a dataset of high-resolution and low-resolution images. Once trained, the model can be used to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images.

# Installation: 
The project can be installed using the following command:

# Code snippet
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage: 
The project can be used to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images using the following command:
# python main.py --input_image <path_to_low_resolution_image> --output_image <path_to_high_resolution_image>

# Results: 
The project has been shown to be effective in generating high-quality high-resolution images from low-resolution images.
